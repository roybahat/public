_Last updated: May 14th, 2017._

This page is accessible from [busterbenson.com/now](http://busterbenson.com/now), and was inspired by [this post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).

Here's what I'm doing now:

* Living in Berkeley, CA, with Kellianne, Niko, and Louie.
* Working at [Slack](http://slack.com) as a product lead for the platform team.
* On the board of directors at [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org).
* An advisor to [Coach.me](http://coach.me), a platform for self-improvement.
* Helping Kellianne keep [750 Words](http://750words.com) alive.
